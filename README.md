# Web-Design-Challenge
The website, made with bootstrap, consist of 7 pages total, to show off the graphs and analysis from the Python-API-Challenge. Pages include:
  1. A landing page containing an explanation of the project, and links to each visualizations page.
  2. Four visualization pages, each with, a descriptive title and heading tag, the plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison, and a paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
  3. A "Comparisons" page that contains all of the visualizations on the same page for easy visual comparison. 
  4. A "Data" page that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The site also has a navigation menu that:
  - Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
  - Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
  - Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
  - Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change).

This website is deployed to [GitHub pages](https://jnnhuynh-web.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/)
